# Gravity-project
This is a gravity project made from scratch. I always try to be AI-free in my codes. If I have used an AI I will mention it. This project simulates the force of attraction formulated by Isaac Newton between 2 bodies of matter. NOTE: THIS IS 2D

The first step to making my project was to simulate a simple uniform velocity along a 2d plane.
The vector quantity of velocity can be resolved into a simple change in the X and Y axes. Therefore, the velocity of an object is determined by its change in x and y in a given time.
